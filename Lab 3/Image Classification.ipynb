In the context of image classification, MLE helps to quantify the probability of observing the data within each predefined class based on their distinct statistical properties. This method is highly effective for classifying images into categories by comparing the likelihoods of the data under different model parameters, enabling the most probable class assignment.\n","\n","1. **Calculate Class Priors**: Estimate the probability of each class based on the training dataset. This is expressed as:\n","   $$\n","   P(C_k) = \\frac{N_k}{N}\n","   $$\n","   where \\(N_k\\) is the number of samples of class \\(k\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of samples.\n","\n","2. **Estimate Class-specific Parameters**: For each class, estimate parameters such as the mean \\(\\mu_k\\) and covariance \\(\\Sigma_k\\) of features that describe the distribution of the data:\n","   $$\n","   \\mu_k = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{x \\in C_k} x\n","   $$\n","   $$\n","   \\Sigma_k = \\frac{1}{N_k} \\sum_{x \\in C_k} (x - \\mu_k)(x - \\mu_k)^T\n","   $$\n","\n","3. **Compute Likelihoods**: For a given test instance \\(x\\), compute the likelihood of that instance belonging to each class using the estimated parameters:\n","   $$\n","   p(x | C_k) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{d/2} |\\Sigma_k|^{1/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} (x - \\mu_k)^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} (x - \\mu_k)\\right)\n","   $$\n","\n","4. **Classify Based on Maximum Likelihood**: Assign the class label to each test instance based on the highest likelihood, which can be calculated as:\n","   $$\n","   \\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{k} P(C_k) \\cdot p(x | C_k)\n","   $$\n","\n","The Naive Bayes classifier is perhaps the most well-known application of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator principle in classification tasks. It assumes that the features in each class are independent, simplifying the computation of likelihoods. While Naive Bayes is popular for its simplicity and efficiency, it is not the only technique that leverages the MLE approach. Other classical alternatives include Logistic Regression, which applies MLE to estimate the parameters that best predict categorical outcomes, and Gaussian Mixture Models, which use MLE to estimate the parameters of multiple Gaussian distributions within the data.
